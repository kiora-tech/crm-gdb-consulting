# PWA Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots used in the PWA manifest for app store listings.

## Required Screenshots

For optimal PWA store listing, the following screenshots should be provided:

### Desktop Screenshots (form_factor: "wide")
- `desktop-customers.png` - 1280x800px - Customer management view
- `desktop-dashboard.png` - 1280x800px - Dashboard overview

### Mobile Screenshots (form_factor: "narrow")  
- `mobile-dashboard.png` - 390x844px - Mobile dashboard
- `mobile-customers.png` - 390x844px - Mobile customer list

## Current Status

Screenshots are placeholder entries in manifest.json. To complete PWA implementation:

1. Take actual screenshots of the application in both desktop and mobile viewports
2. Optimize images for web (WebP format recommended)
3. Update manifest.json with correct screenshot paths
4. Test PWA installation prompts

## Tools for Screenshot Generation

- Browser DevTools Device Mode for mobile screenshots
- Automated screenshot tools like Playwright or Puppeteer
- Manual screenshots using browser extensions

Screenshots should showcase the core features and beautiful UI of the CRM application.
